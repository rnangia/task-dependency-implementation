# task-dependency-implementation

About:
A Binary tree whose nodes are tasks. Each task takes an arbitrary amount of time. This script parallelizes the execution of tasks- which must be run in the dependency order ( child first , parent later). Parallel execution is done on threads.

I use Python v 3.5.1

The external libraries I used for this project are:	<br />
	threading : https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/threading.html <br />
	datetime  : https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html <br />
	random    : https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/random.html <br />
  
From command line (terminal) run as : python task.py
